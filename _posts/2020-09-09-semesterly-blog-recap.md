This is my recap of the blogs posted in Week 3. 

[Kailey perfectly sums up what is data](https://kmaclin17.github.io/2020/09/04/slug.html) **Data is scalar and compound, it can be numbers and words and pictures, and more.** 
Data visualizations communicate information. Scalar, compound, and list data are data that make up the majority of visualizations.
Itâ€™s the human touch that manipulates the data and turns them into meaningful forms of information. The code is a form of writing, as such coding is also a form of expression and requires creativity. It seems that coding has a reputation of being rigid. The most common thought of writing is expressing words on a page. Those words make up sentences, and those sentences make up paragraphs, be it through pen to paper or typing on a computer. However, code is forgotten. The words and numbers can make up strings.
We look at writing and ask ourselves what can be done to make it more effective, more persuasive, more organized. Likewise, we can look at data visualizations, which are the results of the data, and ask the same questions. The language of code is overlooked [as noted by Murphy Scott](https://murphyscott.github.io/2020/09/02/what-is-data.html).
