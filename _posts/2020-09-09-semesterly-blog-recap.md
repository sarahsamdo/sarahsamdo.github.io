This is my recap of the class’s blogs posted in Week 3. 

It’s not a typical activity to think about what exactly is data. Data is not specifically tied to the digital world. Data is everywhere. For example, a nutrition facts label contains data. The names of the macronutrients, the minerals, and the vitamins and the corresponding number for each is data. All the pieces of data together gives us information about the nutrition content of the food item. [Kailey gives a great summation of what data is](https://kmaclin17.github.io/2020/09/04/slug.html): **Data is scalar and compound, it can be numbers and words and pictures, and more.** 

However, individual pieces of data are usually not enough to give information about a place, thing, or concept. Articles, websites, and figures are some ways to organize data into information. Data visualizations can take many forms, such as graphs, charts, and timelines. It is required to have some creativity about how to organize the data and find the best way to communicate the data in meaningful ways. Scalar, dictionary compound, and list compound data are combined to make up the majority of websites and visualizations.

It’s the human touch that manipulates the data and turns them into meaningful forms of information. Coding could be regarded as a form of writing, as such coding is also a form of expression and requires creativity. It seems that coding has a reputation of being rigid. The most common thought of writing is expressing words on a page. Those words make up sentences, and those sentences make up paragraphs, be it through pen to paper or typing on a computer. However, code is forgotten. The words and numbers can make up strings. 

We look at writing and ask ourselves what can be done to make it more effective, more persuasive, more organized. Likewise, we can look at data visualizations, which are representing the results of the data, and ask the same questions. It’s vital for both writing and visualizations to think about the audience. There is a structure required for submitting academic papers and for scientific lab reports. Stories need planning with storyboards. **The language of code is overlooked** [as noted by Murphy Scott](https://murphyscott.github.io/2020/09/02/what-is-data.html). People can write in digital spaces because of data, but people can also write the data that allows writing in digital spaces. Thinking about the writing in these lesser thought about digital spaces is new territory for many. 

It dawns upon me that writing is everywhere and escapes no one. These databases can’t enter themselves; these visualizations can’t render themselves. The people behind these digital creations are not often thought of as writers, but perhaps they are. Writing within these digital spaces requires more than being a code monkey.
