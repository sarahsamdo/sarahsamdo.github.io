This is my reflection on "What is Style?"

I mentioned before that HTML and Markdown are two mark-up languages used for web development. This week we covered the language Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, which allows the manipulation of the website's appearance.

I will be analyzing this [web page](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/). This website contains information on the CSS language such as its applications, how to use it, and information on other languages. 

Viewing the page source, I can see that the doctype is displayed in HTML. However, when I look through the page source, it is clear that the CSS language has been used as well.

It is not a sin to use different languages in a project when a certain language falls short for the purposes you need it for. It is this very reason why having knowledge of multiple languages is necessary.
