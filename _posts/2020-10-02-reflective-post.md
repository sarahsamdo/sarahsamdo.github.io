This is my reflection on "What is Style?"

 
I mentioned before that HTML and Markdown are two mark-up languages used for web development. This week we covered the language Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, which allows the manipulation of the website's appearance.
 
I will be analyzing this [web page](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/). This website contains information on the CSS language such as its applications, how to use it, and information on other languages. 
 
Viewing the page source, I can see that the doctype is displayed in HTML. However, when I look through the page source, it is clear that the CSS language has been used as well. I see the <style> tag has been used for in-line styles in web page. Underneath the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, the following is included: 
<code>.top {
position:relative;
background-color:#ffffff;
height:68px;
padding-top:20px;
line-height:50px;
overflow:hidden;
z-index:2;
}</code>
This text is only a sample of what else is displayed in the page source. But what we can derive from this text, is that the language was used to change specific dimensions and colors for display on the web page. 
 
It is not a sin to use different languages in a project when a certain language falls short for the purposes you need it for. It is this very reason why having knowledge of multiple languages is necessary.
