My reflection on "What is a File?"
 
It has been established from last week that data must be organized so that meaningful information can be derived from it. This week begins to explore the data structures of the computer and the ways the computer stores data.
 
Computers store data as files, then those files can be stored into folders which can contain more files and folders. It is essentially an  organization system of parents and children. The lineage of folders inside folders can continue as long as there is a parent.
 
I chose [this web page](https://www.forensicfocus.com/webinars/trust-but-verify-digital-artifact-edition/) titled "Trust But Verify: Digital Artifact Edition" by the Forensic Focus. The content of the web page is to provide information on how someone can use digital forensics by looking through files and folders. 
The page source of this web page can be viewed by pressing the right mouse button and clicking on "View page source" or ctrl+U. After opening its page source, the organization of this web page can be analyzed.
 
The beginning of the page source starts with "<html lang=”en-US”>". As such, the page source is displayed in HTML, and as specified, in US English. 
The paragraphs of the article can also be seen in the page source stored as "<p>". The pictures in the article are stored as "<figure>". There are also a number of "<a>" tags for the links displayed as icons and tabs on the web page. I do not have the requisite background to critique improvements in the HTML document. However, if the code for this document was editable, then the person in charge of the website could make the necessary changes in the code and have the changes show up on their web page. 
 
The article itself addresses the importance of files, in the context of digital forensics. The data stored in computers can be analyzed to verify and provide evidence for criminal cases. It is possible to check the deleted dates of files or when they were accessed, to pull times, and to check whether something is being written at a certain time.
