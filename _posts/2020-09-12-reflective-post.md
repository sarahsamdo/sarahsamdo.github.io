My reflection on "What is a File?"

It has been established from last week that data must be organized so that meaningful information can be derived from it. This week begins to expore the data structures of the computer and the wasys the computer stores data.

Computers store data as files, then those files can be stored into folders which can contain more files and folders. It is essentially an  organization system of parents and children. The lineage of folders inside folders can continue as long as there is a parent.


I chose [this web page](https://www.forensicfocus.com/webinars/trust-but-verify-digital-artifact-edition/) titled "Trust But Verify: Digital Artifact Edition" by the Forensic Focus. The content of the web page is to provide information on how someone can use digital forensics by looking through files and folders. 
Here we can view the [page source](view-source:https://www.forensicfocus.com/webinars/trust-but-verify-digital-artifact-edition/) of this web page and analyze the its organization.
