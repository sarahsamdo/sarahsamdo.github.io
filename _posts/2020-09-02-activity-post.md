My thoughts on the effectivess of three different data visualizations.

**Team Member Cards** [Visualization 1](https://codepen.io/oncomouse/full/xxVEWzR)

The visualization uses dictionary compound data. By arranging the data in a list with only names and position shown, the visual display avoids cluttering the audience with too much information. It's also easy to access the hidden information with a simple click. However, If there were a longer list of employees, the current arrangement can become incredibly unwieldy. The visualization could be more effective by arranging the employees in alphabetical order. 

**The Demographics of Others** [Visualization 2](https://flowingdata.com/2018/01/23/the-demographics-of-others/)

While visually appealing, a disadvantage of these charts is the lack of percentage transparency. Instead of communcating the exact percentages to the audience, we would need to count the squares and calculate the amount filled to get a percentage. 

**"Based on a True Story** [Visualization 3](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/)

The arrangement of the data appears cluttered, but there is still order to the data.
