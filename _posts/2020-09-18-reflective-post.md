My reflection on "What is Markup?"

HTML is a commonly used markup language. This week explored another language called Markdown. Markup is in extremely simple terms, the general formatting of a document. HTML and Markdown are two markup languages that have different ways of “marking up” a document, as in they have different ways to process and present documents. It seems odd and counterintuitive that a markup language is called Markdown. In actuality, looking at the concept of Markdown can ease that confusion. The concept behind Markdown is that the language is simpler to write in, so the formatting of the documents would require less complicated markups. 

This article here(https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) is a guide for getting started with Markdown and introducing its applications. Using my Google Chrome browser, I can press ctrl + U or view page source and the HTML document for the page will show up.

Comparing the images shown in the article for Markdown to the HTML code, Markdown is significantly easier on the eyes because of its simplicity. Some advantages to Markdown is that Markdown is typically converted to display as HTML, which is a common markup language most people would be able to understand, and one does not have to write in the HTML language in order to develop and display web applications.

As mentioned in this week’s reading, tags are incredibly important to the HTML language for formatting. Messing up tags in the confusing HTML syntax can cause frustration for many. In Markdown, the need for the proper tags around blocks of text, lists, and headings would not be as much as a concern because of its ease of use. However, having the ability to read HTML is an essential skill. By viewing the HTML document for the Markdown guide’s page, I can see <code><em></code> tags that are used around “Markdown processor” and “Markdown application” and <code><strong></code>  tags around “Note.” There is also a great number of <code>href</code> tags throughout the HTML page source document.
