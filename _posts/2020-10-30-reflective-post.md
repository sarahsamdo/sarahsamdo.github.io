This is my reflection on "What is Audience?"

I am in a group with two other people, and the links to their sites are [here](https://kmaclin17.github.io/) and [here](https://selinkorkmaz.github.io/). Our project will be a website focused on informing our audience, which will be A&M students specifically, about the voting process.
This week we spent time brainstorming what our potential website could look like and what information it would contain, but besides our identified audience, we do not have anything set in stone yet. We do not want our website to be biased and will likely include debate videos, so the audience can make their own informed choice. Additionally, we would like to include A&M themes to make the site more personal. The site is not going to be anything flashy, but rather more professional. The implied audience can be any other person interested in voting in Brazos County, Blinn students, or someone interested in knowing how college students go about voting. 
There are many websites out there about the voting process and what you can do to register, where to vote, and how to vote, however there is not much specifically geared to A&M students. Which is why we are inspired to do so. This website [here](https://www.vote.org/) provides a general idea of what we would like to do information wise, but more specific to an audience instead of generally towards everyone. There is a lot of information that is unnecessary for A&M students, so that is why we would filter the information we would want and is relevant on our website. The website, however, is a good format that we can draw inspiration from.
