I am in a group with [insert here} and [insert here]. Our project will be a website focused on informing our audience about voting, which will be A&M students.
There are many websites out there about the voting process and what you can do to register, where to vote, and how to vote, however there is not much geared specifically geared to
A&M students. Which is why we are inspired to do so. This website here provides a general idea of what we would like to do information wise, but more specific to an audience instead of
generally towareds everyone. There is a lot of information that is unnecessary for students, so that is why we would filter the information we would want and deem relevant on our website.
