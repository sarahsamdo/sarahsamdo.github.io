This is my second update on the final project for this class.

We discussed extensively how we plan to differentiate our site from other websites and existing regarding voting. The main point for our site is to be much more modern, sleeker, and cleaner. The younger demographic nowadays prefer using sites that are modern and up to date because older sites can often look sketchy and are sketchy. OUr site will not only look more modern, but take into consideration the questions many people movoing from different counties or different sates may have and provide information that may not be readily available online because the web sites are not kept up to date. Additionally, another reason why information that TAMU students may not be able to find is that residents in Braxos county may not realize that information known to the community is not known to thsoe who are new to the area.
