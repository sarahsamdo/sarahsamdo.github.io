I decided on using an external file with a .css extension rather than the in-lyne style because of Dr. Pilschâ€™s recommendation, and so the style sheet would not have to be repeated on every page. I was unsure of what to change on my website because I already liked the way it looked. I chose to change the coloring of text for the content from white to crimson red on the website so I could personalize it and keep true to the look it already has. (Work in Progress)
