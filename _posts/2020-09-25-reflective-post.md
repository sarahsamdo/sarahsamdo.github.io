My reflection on “What is Metadata?”

Metadata is still data, but since data itself is an extremely broad term, metadata gives a more specific meaning to what the data is. Metadata gives data about the data, essentially communicating facts about the data that would be the main content. 

For this week’s reflection, I will be analyzing the HTML page source document of [this web page](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-apples) which talks about the benefits of apples. 

When looking at metadata in HTML, many tags can be seen throughout the page source document. Those tags would not show up in the actual website page displayed, but the tags are metadata because those dogs communicate information about the data inside them. As such, I would know which pieces of text were intended to be titles, headings, and links. The first line shows the following: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> <code>&lt;html lang=”en”&gt;</code>. Immediately, I know that the document is in HTML language and also in English. None of this information is shown on the actual web page, but the page source communicates that about the data. There are a number of <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags seen in the beginning of the HTML document as well. For example, the line <code>&lt;meta name="article:author" content="Kerri-Ann Jennings, MS, RD"&gt;</code> tells us many things. “Meta name” is the metadata and article author is the data. “Content” is the metadata and the data is  “Kerri-Ann Jennings, MS, RD.” As previously mentioned, there is a great quantity of metadata at the beginning of the document which includes the <code>og:image</code> property. 

It would appear the metadata is tedious because of the constant need to define every piece of data, but metadata helps immensely with tasks such as organization and communication for proper display on a website.
