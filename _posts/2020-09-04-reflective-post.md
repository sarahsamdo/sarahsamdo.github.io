My reflection on "What is Data?"

Computers are only as smart as one's ability to program them. All the beautiful visualizations must be organized by someone. The computer requires someone to input the data and arrange it to communicate information in a meaningful way. Otherwise, there would be a bunch of nonsense information and no way to analyze and compare it. Data is the raw facts and raw numbers that when collected, give us information. Interestingly, data is more than just the numbers and individual words in a program to manipulate a website page or arranging information in figures. I never thought before that data is also the words in a book. Data is the content of articles. As such, data is also the facts delivered through videos, as well as the exchanges of data to display the video on a website and play it. 

[This page](https://www.fema.gov/data-visualization-summary-disaster-declarations-and-grants) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, website contains an interactive tool and multiple visualizations to analyze historic federal disaster declarations by state, county, hazard, and year. FEMA combines list compound data and dictionary compound data. The visualizations after selecting a state or territory name, which is a text scalar value, from the drop down list change and display information specific to that state or territory. Then the number of disasters that have occurred, the months of when disasters occurred, the years of when the disasters occured, and the types of disasters that have occurred are shown with their own visualization. The first visual uses a list to display the numbers of disasters along with the types, and a map also showing numbers of disasters by territory. FEMA uses bar charts to show the months and years of the disaster occurrences. FEMA uses a list to show the disasters that have occured in a chosen state with the titles of each column as follows: Year of Declaration Date, Declaration Title, and Disaster Number. A con to using a list is that the only way to view the information is by scrolling. It might be more effective if a timeline had been used.
