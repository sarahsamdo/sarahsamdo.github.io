This is my **first post**.

[Here's a website I like](https://openstax.org/)

I'm currently a junior Arts and Sciences major at A&M. I am also born and raised in College Station, so the water isn't that weird to me, believe it or not. 
I have a strong interest in skincare. Unfortunately for me, it's a struggle to get my husband to stick to a basic skincare routine. He just won't wear sunscreen! He's also blessed with genetically great skin, so he doesn't understand why I want him to take care of it. 
On another note, my husband is an avid gamer, and we frequently play games together. Risk of Rain 2 is one of our favorites! Path of Exile is another favorite, and it's free, so I strongly recommend this game for everyone.  
As for why I'm taking this class...
I'm pursuing a minor in English for fun. I don't have a deep reason for joining this course, but I read through the different 400-level options and simply thought this course would be interesting. Regardless, I am excited for what is in store this semester.
